# Catwalk back-end

A retail e-commerce website was horizontally scaling and required optimization of the back-end.

- Reshaped legacy data to fit a PostgreSQL table structure
- Used joins and indexing to increase query speed
- Created an ETL node.js tool to simplify database seeding
- Used Loader.io to stress test
- Measured performance increase after implementing 5 AWS EC2 instance servers and a NGINX load balancer
